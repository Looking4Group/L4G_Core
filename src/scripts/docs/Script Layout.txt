--- Script Layout ---
A quick explination of the layout I hope everyone will follow for scriptdev2.

--- Sub Folders ---

Area - Contains scripts used solely by area triggers

Boss - Boss scripts for bosses that are not zone specific

Mob - Generic Creature scripts for creatures that are not zone specific

Custom - Intentionally empty folder from SVN. If you make a custom script please put it here.

GO - Contains scripts used solely by Game Objects (GOs) that do not have a specific zone

Guard - Scripts for Guard NPCs

Honor - Honor npcs (currently a blank script as these npcs do nothing special)

Item - Item scripts

NPC - Scripts for individual NPCs who do not have a specific zone

Servers - Generic NPC servers script for things such as flightmasters and guildmasters.

Zone - ALL zone specific scripts should be written within these folders. This includes creature scripts, boss scripts, go scripts, area scripts, and npc scripts.

--- Naming Conventions ---

Please keep file names to "type_objectname.cpp" where type is replaced by the type of object and objectname is replaced by the name of the object, creature, item, or area that this script will be used by.

AddSC functions should follow "void AddSC_creaturename(void);" format. Do not append AI or anything else.
